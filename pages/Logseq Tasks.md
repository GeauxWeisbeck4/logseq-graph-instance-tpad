	- ## Usage
		- Logseq comes with two built-in flavors to mark your block with built-in workflow marker keywords and manage your tasks:
			- `LATER` -> `NOW` -> `DONE` flavor (default)
			- `TODO` -> `DOING` -> `DONE` flavor
			- You can toggle between those two flavors in the settings page
		- There are two ways to attach workflow markers to your task block:
		- when editing the block, press `Ctrl/Cmd+enter` to cycle through the workflow markers
		- type these commands directly (eg `/LATER`) anywhere in the block, or manually write the keyword at the start of the block (eg `LATER do grocery`)
		- Some examples:
		- LATERdo grocery
		- NOWplay with Logseq
		- watch Doctor Who
		- (_this is how `DONE` renders_)
		- In addition to the workflows described above, there's also `CANCELED`/`CANCELLED`, `IN-PROGRESS`, and `WAIT`/`WAITING` markers which can be typed directly.
		- Some examples:
		- the boring thing
		- (_this is how `CANCELLED` renders_)
		- IN-PROGRESSthe fun thing
		- WAITthe slow thing
		- Once the block has been created, if it shows an empty tick-box at the start of the block you can manually click on that box to get it to change to `DONE`, which can be rather satisfying to do.
	- ## Functionality
		- ### Priorities
			- Logseq comes with three optional, built-in priorities that can be set with commands (`/A`, `/B`, `/C`):
			- type
			- :
			- [[
			- Command
			- ]]
			- name
			- :
			- A
			- description
			- :
			- Highest priority
			- type
			- :
			- [[
			- Command
			- ]]
			- name
			- :
			- B
			- description
			- :
			- Mid level priority
			- type
			- :
			- [[
			- Command
			- ]]
			- name
			- :
			- C
			- description
			- :
			- Lowest priority
			- Example:
			- LATER
			- [[#A]](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/A)
			- big important and urgent thing
			- LATER
			- [[#C]](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/C)
			- the lower priority thing
			- Again, these can either be added by using the commands (typing `/A`), or manually added by writing `[#A]` at the start of the block after the marker.
		- ### Deadline and Scheduled
			- There are two commands for setting dates on a block:
			- type
			- :
			- [[
			- Command
			- ]]
			- name
			- :
			- Deadline
			- description
			- :
			- Type command `/Deadline` to choose a deadline date for a block
			- eg: finish reading 1984 by 29th of May
			- DEADLINE:
			- <2021-05-29 Sat>
			- type
			- :
			- [[
			- Command
			- ]]
			- name
			- :
			- Scheduled
			- description
			- :
			- Type command `/Scheduled` to setup a scheduled date for a block
			- eg: send John a birthday card Monday
			- SCHEDULED:
			- <2021-05-31 Mon>
			- Both of the above commands work on regular blocks too, not just tasks.
			- Both of the above commands default to displaying blocks that are coming up soon. You can configure how soon with `:scheduled/future-days` in [[
			- config.edn
			- ]].
			- Both of above commands support to mark the task as repeated:
			- after typing the command and click `Add repeater` in the date picker
			- eg: daily exercise routine at 7am
			- SCHEDULED:
			- <2021-05-26 Wed 07:00 .+1d>
			- You can change the repeater kind to:
			- `.+`: It'll repeat from the last time you marked the block done.
			- `++`: It'll keep it on the same day of the week.
			- `+`: It'll repeat in X y/m/w/d/h from when you originally scheduled it.
		- ### Time tracker
			- 1.  ⏱️ Time tracker
			- Logseq will record the time when you add or update the block todo keyword and display the spent time once you checked the task.
				- Example
					- The spent time for this block is `18s`.
					- you can toggle this off by [[setting/enable timetracking]]
