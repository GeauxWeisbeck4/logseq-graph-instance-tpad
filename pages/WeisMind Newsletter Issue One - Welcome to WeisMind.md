- description:: This is the very first issue ever so buckle in.
- ## Intro
	- I’ve struggled with how to start this new publication, what to write about, and what kind of knowledge I could share that would be practical and user to readers. To say my life has been a wild ride would be an understatement, but just sharing that story would get boring - people want value out of a newsletter and I don’t know what value you would get out of hearing my story. I'm not too egotistical to realize that.
	- What's been more challenging is trying to figure out a niche where I can apply the skills I've invested most of my time in the last few years can be shared in a unique way, while telling a story. I've spent the last four to five years learning full-stack development, really in particularly difficult circumstances.
