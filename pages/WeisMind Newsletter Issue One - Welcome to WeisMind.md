- title:: Issue One - Welcome to WeisMind
- description:: This is the very first issue ever so buckle in.
- ## Intro
	- I've wanted to write this newsletter for a really long time, but it has been a challenge. I had an idea of what I wanted it to be, and for a while, I thought I was just too scared to write it (and I was), but the real truth came to me today. It's not just that I WAS scared to write this, I knew that I had nothing to offer, nothing to important to say really. I didn't know what to write because I had to think about it, mold it to something that sounded like something other people want to hear, and I could never complete the process of sitting down and writing this. It's been about two years of this, ever since I decided I wanted to write my personal newsletter.
	- I've probably drafted this article 20-30 times in full. Another 50 times, I've sat and stared at a blinking cursor for a half hour before typing a sentence or two, deleting it, and repeating that three or four more times until I gave up. My fiance says that's the reason we are so broke and nobody reads my content, but I say its just my writing process. For a while, I thought I would forever be in writer's purgatory, but looking back I can see that I really never was in writer's purgatory at all. Now I can see that I was still a pupil to life, unable to accept the truth of it because it  seemed like doing so would eliminate every idea I've ever had of myself, and I actually did eliminate every idea of who I THOUGHT I was.
	- It's not like I'm a dunce at all, in fact I am very intelligent. I have a college degree, I've taught myself full-stack software development, and I can learn anything that I want to. It's completely understandable why my life partner Lisa would feel like I'm wasting my talents by not publishing something to make money when we are struggling so bad, or that maybe I just don't have the confidence to get a job (a feat I've been going at for a few years now). Sure, I could sit down for a few weeks and teach you Python, content marketing, or how to start an ecommerce store. But I'd be doing every single person a disservice by not offering them something I have that is of way more value.
	- You see, I've been a tutor, entrepreneur, marketer, writer - you fucking name it, I've fucking done it. Experience or knowledge are two things that I have plenty of to share, and I will, believe me - it's just probably not in the way that "you are supposed" to share knowledge, because in the US of A, when you know a skill that can make money, then dammit you better use it and get real fuckin rich buddy. Now that last sentence I just wrote, about sharing your knowledge to get rich - that is the problem that this newsletter addresses and the best thing I can offer anyone is to get you to realize something, not sell you info. You want info, use Perplexity AI, Google, or pick up a fuckin encyclopedia.
	- The entire purpose of WeisMind is this: to help you realize that you have all the power. I know that seems simple, and please don't think that reading that one sentence is adequate and you don't have to subscribe to this newsletter to learn more, because that is only the central theme. I have a lot of different lessons and many stories to entertain you with that reverberate this core idea.
	- You will soon see that this is so applicable to everything in life if you do decide to subscribe to this newsletter, which you totally should because every issue is absolutely free - I don't believe in putting content behind paywalls, especially if it's a truth that is necessary for saving the world. There are paid subscriptions that will offer additional features that are super special for paying subscribers, but I feel like you should pay me if you feel like it's worth your money and you feel I'm worthy of the help. I'm about to talk about this, but I really could use any help anyone has to offer though - I'm humble enough to admit that and ask for your hard earned money if you can afford it. I just think it's fucked up if I tell you to read this because it will help you a lot and then you go to read it and you can't because you're broke (just like myself), which makes you sad every time you think about me and WeisMind because everybody is reading this newsletter and you can't (this is how you make me feel Medium and Substack writers I love).
	- Just to be clear, this does not mean that I put little effort into this newsletter and it really isn't worth your time. I'm just being straight up honest with y'all, because that's who I am - no AI generated CTA catch phrases to get you to subscribe. Just good ol Andrew and generic orange Substack subscribe and share buttons in very convenient places for everyone to click. There are going to be times where you will be wondering what in the fuck does this issue have to do with anything?
	- Just because I'm not giving you step-by-step directions on how to make money with AI, sharing pickup lines that will get you laid, or telling you how to hack into the Swift Payment system using assembly language, doesn't mean that the knowledge I am sharing can't help you do any of those things. In fact, what I write about is much more valuable than that shit and that is not because of what I am saying necessarily. Really, it is because you are too smart for some sugarcoated, click-bait, bullshit post that somebody shared because it helps them, not YOU.
	- And that's not to say I won't teach you about those things, because I'm very much going to talk about AI, technology, and marketing. My writing often includes topics such as psychology, relationships, and confidence. You will notice that I may have an issue in the future called "Learn About AI With Andrew", or some other kind of issue or resource as a one off that readers request or that I think will help you. But that is not going to be my format for doing things because that gets dull and I FUCKING HATE DULL, so don't expect me to have a particular structure that I follow.
	- So it's best to wrap all this up right now and leave you with a summary and couple bullet points of why you should subscribe to WeisMind and recommend me to your Substack readers. I'd love to completely introduce myself if it'd help you become a subscriber, but I want to create an intermission in the story that leaves the audience wanting to come back for more. Think of it like the way HBO would leave you at the end of a Game of Thrones or True Detective (the first and third season) episode, not comparing my writing to either one of those, but that's just the general idea behind my approach.
	- If you are more confused right now than you were before you read this issue, than I think we are on the right track. Honestly, writing this first issue has been so fucking challenging because WeisMind is one of those "you got to see it first to know what I'm talking about" kind of things. As Rust Cohle from True Detective would say:
	- > WeisMind Newsletter is a flat circle. Everything I'm going to tell you that has happened, has already happened - in fact, it's happening right now as you read this.  And it will continue to happen again, and again, and again, and again... forever through all of time. And time - time is something we can't even begin to understand.
