- ## Intro
	- I’ve struggled with how to start this new publication, what to write about, and what kind of knowledge I could share that would be practical and user to readers. To say my life has been a wild ride would be an understatement, but just sharing that story would get boring - people want value out of a newsletter and I don’t know what value you would get out of hearing my story. I'm not too egotistical to realize that.
	- What's been more challenging is trying to figure out a niche where I can apply the skills I've invested most of my time in the last few years can be shared in a unique way, while telling a story. I've spent the last four to five years learning full-stack development, in particularly difficult circumstances really. While I've learned a lot and certainly feel like I can write code at a somewhat advanced level, I don't know if I have anything to offer developers at this point that isn't something already out there - in other words, I feel like I am still learning a lot and/or haven't found a niche I would be expert enough in to be effective in my writing. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right; but I can tell you that is much more difficult to admit than "my story isn't cool enough to tell anyone."
	- So that has been my dilemma for the last 18 months to two years of thinking about how to start this publication. But something happened recently in November that changed things - a pretty terrible something and I realized what that meant for the future of our country, people I love, and people who I don't know but love because they are a part of my really big family called "fellow Americans." Sure, we all have differences, but the only people I hate here are the enemies who threaten our independence and freedom, and that is a very real threat in this moment in time.
	- So this threat opened up an opportunity to create, but what? What is there to be said, done, or taught that hasn't been said or done? Well, a lot really... but at the end of last week it sort of came to me while reading through Substack - I think there is something I can write about that is useful, and it really involves my entire experience. Mainly my experience of the last two and half years of an absolutely struggle filled and trying existence, but also through the many things I've learned on that journey. I'm still not exactly sure what to call it, but I'll take a stab at what I'm working on here.
