- ## Intro
	- I've wanted to write this newsletter for a really long time, but it has been a challenge. I had an idea of what I wanted it to be, and for a while, I thought I was just too scared to write it (and I was), but the real truth came to me today. It's not just that I WAS scared to write this, I knew that I had nothing to offer, nothing to important to say really. I didn't know what to write because I had to think about it, mold it to something that sounded like something other people want to hear, and I could never complete the process of sitting down and writing this. It's been about two years of this, ever since I decided I wanted to write my personal newsletter.
	- I've probably drafted this article 20-30 times in full. Another 50 times, I've sat and stared at a blinking cursor for a half hour before typing a sentence or two, deleting it, and repeating that three or four more times until I gave up.
