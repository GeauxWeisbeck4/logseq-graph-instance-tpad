- title:: Issue One - Welcome to WeisMind
- description:: This is the very first issue ever so buckle in.
- ## Intro
	- I've wanted to write this newsletter for a really long time, but it has been a challenge. I had an idea of what I wanted it to be, and for a while, I thought I was just too scared to write it (and I was), but the real truth came to me today. It's not just that I WAS scared to write this, I knew that I had nothing to offer, nothing to important to say really. I didn't know what to write because I had to think about it, mold it to something that sounded like something other people want to hear, and I could never complete the process of sitting down and writing this. It's been about two years of this, ever since I decided I wanted to write my personal newsletter.
	- I've probably drafted this article 20-30 times in full. Another 50 times, I've sat and stared at a blinking cursor for a half hour before typing a sentence or two, deleting it, and repeating that three or four more times until I gave up. My fiance says that's the reason we are so broke and nobody reads my content, but I say its just my writing process. For a while, I thought I would forever be in writer's purgatory, but looking back I can see that I really never was in writer's purgatory at all. Now I can see that I was still a pupil to life, unable to accept the truth of it because it  seemed like doing so would eliminate every idea I've ever had of myself, and I actually did eliminate every idea of who I THOUGHT I was.
	- It's not like I'm a dunce at all, in fact I am very intelligent. I have a college degree, I've taught myself full-stack software development, and I can learn anything that I want to. It's completely understandable why my life partner Lisa would feel like I'm wasting my talents by not publishing something to make money when we are struggling so bad, or that maybe I just don't have the confidence to get a job (a feat I've been going at for a few years now). Sure, I could sit down for a few weeks and teach you Python, content marketing, or how to start an ecommerce store. But I'd be doing every single person a disservice by not offering them something I have that is of way more value.
	- You see, I've been a tutor, entrepreneur, marketer, writer - you fucking name it, I've fucking done it. Experience or knowledge are two things that I have plenty of to share, and I will, believe me - it's just probably not in the way that "you are supposed" to share knowledge, because in the US of A, when you know a skill that can make money, then dammit you better use it and get real fuckin rich buddy. Now that last sentence I just wrote, about sharing your knowledge to get rich - that is the problem that this newsletter addresses and the best thing I can offer anyone is to get you to realize something, not sell you info. You want info, use Perplexity AI, Google, or pick up a fuckin encyclopedia.
	- The entire purpose of WeisMind is this: to help you realize that you have all the power. I know that seems simple, and please don't think that reading that one sentence is adequate and you don't have to subscribe to this newsletter to learn more, because that is only the central theme. I have a lot of different lessons and many stories to entertain you with that reverberate this core idea.
	- You will soon see that this is so applicable to everything in life if you do decide to subscribe to this newsletter, which you totally should because every issue is absolutely free - I don't believe in putting content behind paywalls, especially if it's a truth that is necessary for saving the world. There are paid subscriptions that will offer additional features that are super special for paying subscribers, but I feel like you should pay me if you feel like it's worth your money and you feel I'm worthy of the help - I
