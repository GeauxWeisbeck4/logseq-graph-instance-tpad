- ## Intro
	- I’ve struggled with how to start this new publication, what to write about, and what kind of knowledge I could share that would be practical and user to readers. To say my life has been a wild ride would be an understatement, but just sharing that story would get boring - people want value out of a newsletter and I don’t know what value you would get out of hearing my story. I'm not too egotistical to realize that.
	- What's been more challenging is trying to figure out a niche where I can apply the skills I've invested most of my time in the last few years can be shared in a unique way, while telling a story. I've spent the last four to five years learning full-stack development, in particularly difficult circumstances really. While I've learned a lot and certainly feel like I can write code at a somewhat advanced level, I don't know if I have anything to offer developers at this point that isn't something already out there - in other words, I feel like I am still learning a lot and/or haven't found a niche I would be expert enough in to be effective in my writing. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right; but I can tell you that is much more difficult to admit than "my story isn't cool enough to tell anyone."
	- So that has been my dilemma for the last 18 months to two years of thinking about how to start this publication. But something happened recently in November that changed things.
