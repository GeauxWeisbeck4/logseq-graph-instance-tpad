- title:: Issue One - Welcome to WeisMind
- description:: This is the very first issue ever so buckle in.
- ## Intro
	- I’ve struggled with how to start this new publication, what to write about, and what kind of knowledge I could share that would be practical and user to readers. To say my life has been a wild ride would be an understatement, but just sharing that story would get boring - people want value out of a newsletter and I don’t know what value you would get out of hearing my story. I'm not too egotistical to realize that.
	- What's been more challenging is trying to figure out a niche where I can apply the skills I've invested most of my time in the last few years can be shared in a unique way, while telling a story. I've spent the last four to five years learning full-stack development, in particularly difficult circumstances really. While I've learned a lot and certainly feel like I can write code at a somewhat advanced level, I don't know if I have anything to offer developers at this point that isn't something already out there - in other words, I feel like I am still learning a lot and/or haven't found a niche I would be expert enough in to be effective in my writing. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right; but I can tell you that is much more difficult to admit than "my story isn't cool enough to tell anyone."
	- So that has been my dilemma for the last 18 months to two years of thinking about how to start this publication. But something happened recently in November that changed things - a pretty terrible something and I realized what that meant for the future of our country, people I love, and people who I don't know but love because they are a part of my really big family called "fellow Americans." Sure, we all have differences, but the only people I hate here are the enemies who threaten our independence and freedom, and that is a very real threat in this moment in time.
	- So this threat opened up an opportunity to create, but what? What is there to be said, done, or taught that hasn't been said or done? Well, a lot really... but at the end of last week it sort of came to me while reading through Substack - I think there is something I can write about that is useful, and it really involves my entire experience. Mainly my experience of the last two and half years of an absolutely struggle filled and trying existence, but also through the many things I've learned on that journey. I'm still not exactly sure what to call it, but I'll take a stab at what I'm working on here.
	- WeisMind is a publication that is like a whittle for your mind - a way to sharpen it so it is ready for the things that lie ahead. Real tools, like technology, ideas, and ways to navigate challenging times. Motivation and hope in the form of storytelling and experience. And most importantly, compassion and empathy, which are the strength that each of us shares with one another in fighting the corrupt, evil menace that faces us right now. My goal is to interweave these components into a newsletter that serves as a resource, community, and tool to help you through the struggle that awaits everyone who still believes in a better way.
	- There have been times where everything that has happened in the last few years of my life have felt like the end of me, rock bottom, the final blow. I have fought and fought the notion of, "Hey, there may be a higher purpose in all of this", and I can understand why. But it took me finally breaking down enough to such a vulnerable and weak form of ego for me to have a different perspective and see the reason why all of this struggle, this unfair life, and the absolute humbling of my entire being was so necessary for me to become the most absolute honest, real, and happy version of myself. Nothing worth doing is ever easy - anything worth doing should be the hardest thing you've ever done, in my opinion.
	- Now, I have nothing to hide from anyone and the way people view me is of little importance - I only care that you can trust that I am truthful and that I truly do care about people. Everything else is mostly irrelevant for me. I'm lucky that there is somebody in my life who has become the only person that I truly care what they think because I spend 98% of each day with her. I promise I'm not trying to hide anything, but rather I think it will be more useful and entertaining to share my story piece by piece. Seriously - if you want to really find more out about me, I'm sure a lot of it is out there on the web and I'm even gonna share links to other websites I've created and other places I share content.
	- Alright, I'm done with the riddles and cryptic bs - it's time to get down to why I think you should subscribe. I'm going to straight up with the first reason, and it's purely selfish, but paid subscriptions would really help me out right now. While I do freelance and have been trying to find full-time work, I could really use any kind of help that you could provide. With that being said, this newsletter and all of my content will be free. I want everybody to read what I have to write and
