- # IPFS
	- Open protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring data on the web, built on the ideas of content addressing and peer-to-peer networking.
	- ## Defining IPFS
		- An implementation of IPFS protocol [specifications](https://github.com/ipfs/specs)[](https://github.com/ipfs/specs) [(opens new window)](https://github.com/ipfs/specs), such as Kubo. Learn more about [the principles that define an IPFS implementation](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/implementations/).
		- A decentralized network composed of IPFS nodes that is open and participatory.
		- A modular suite of protocols and standards for organizing and transferring content-addressed data.
	- ## What IPFS Isn't
		- A _storage provider_: While there are storage providers built with IPFS support (typically known as _pinning services_), IPFS itself is a protocol, not a provider.
		- _A cloud service provider_: IPFS can be deployed on and complement cloud infrastructure, but it in of itself is not a cloud service provider.
