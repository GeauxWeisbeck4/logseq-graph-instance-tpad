- # IPFS
	- Open protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring data on the web, built on the ideas of content addressing and peer-to-peer networking.
	- ## Defining IPFS
		- An implementation of IPFS protocol [specifications](https://github.com/ipfs/specs)[](https://github.com/ipfs/specs) [(opens new window)](https://github.com/ipfs/specs), such as Kubo. Learn more about [the principles that define an IPFS implementation](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/implementations/).
		- A modular suite of protocols and standards for organizing and transferring content-addressed data.
		- A decentralized network composed of IPFS nodes that is open and participatory.
