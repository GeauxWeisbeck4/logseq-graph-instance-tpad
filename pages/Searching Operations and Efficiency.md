- # Searching Operations and Efficiency
	- Searching is something we do over and over in computer science. Just like our sorting algorithms, each will vary in complexity and efficiency.

	- ## Search Algorithms
		- ## [[Linear Search]]
		- ## [[Binary Search]]
	- ## Comparison
		- ### Efficiency
			- Binary search is much more efficient as it doesn't go through each and every element
		- ### Prerequisite
			- Binary search requires the data be sorted first, linear search doesn't require data to be sorted
		- ### Use cases
			- Binary search is great for large and sorted data sets. Linear search is good for small unsorted data sets
