- # Searching Operations and Efficiency
	- Searching is something we do over and over in computer science. Just like our sorting algorithms, each will vary in complexity and efficiency.

	- ## Comparison
		- ### Efficiency
			- Binary search is much more efficient as it doesn't go through each and every element
		- ### Prerequisite
			- Binary search requires the data be sorted first, linear search doesn't require data to be sorted
		- ### Use cases
			- Binary search is great for large and sorted data sets. Linear search is good for small unsorted data sets

	- ## Time Complexity
		- ### Worst Case Linear Search `O(n)`
			- If the element we are looking for is at the very end of our data set, we must go through each and every element so the time complexity is O(n)
		- ### Best Case Linear Search  `O(1)`
			- When our element is the very first element in our list, we return it so we get O(1) time complexity
		- It is important to remember that the time complexity for linear search depends on the distribution of the data set. If it is closer to the beginning, our time complexity is more around O(1). If it is evenly distributed, our time complexity is closer to `O(n/2)`.
			- Linear search can also be used in combination with other algorithms to improve it's efficienc
	- ## Space Complexity
		- Linear search has a constant space complexity of `O(1)`, making it very memory efficient and can handle data sets of any size
