# Segment Trees: Range Queries and Updates
	- Segment Trees are powerful data structures used for efficiently processing range queries and updates on arrays. They allow you to perform operations like finding the sum, minimum, or maximum within a given range of indices, as well as updating individual elements, all in logarithmic time. This makes them significantly faster than naive approaches, especially when dealing with a large number of queries and updates.
	- ## Core Concepts of Segment Trees
		- A Segment Tree is essentially a binary tree where each node represents an interval (or segment) of the original array. The root node represents the entire array, and each internal node represents the union of its two children. The leaves of the tree represent individual elements of the array.
		- ### Construction
			- The segment tree is built in a bottom-up manner.
				- 1.  **Leaf Nodes:** The leaf nodes store the values of the original array elements.
				- 2.  **Internal Nodes:** Each internal node stores the result of applying a specific operation (e.g., sum, min, max) to the values stored in its children.
			- The construction process is typically recursive. Given an array `arr` of size `n`, the segment tree for the array is constructed as follows:
				- If the range `[start, end]` contains only one element (i.e., `start == end`), then the node stores the value of `arr[start]`.
				- Otherwise, the range `[start, end]` is divided into two halves: `[start, mid]` and `[mid+1, end]`, where `mid = (start + end) / 2`.
				- Recursively construct the segment trees for the left and right halves.
				- The value of the current node is obtained by combining the values of its two children using the specified operation.
		- ### Range Queries
			- A range query asks for the result of applying a specific operation to a sub-array of the original array. For example, a range sum query asks for the sum of the elements in the sub-array `arr[L...R]`.
			- To perform a range query on a segment tree, we traverse the tree starting from the root node. At each node, we check if the range represented by the node is completely contained within the query range.
				- If it is, then we simply return the value stored in the node.
				- Otherwise, we recursively perform the query on the left and right children, and combine the results.
				- If the range represented by the node is completely outside the query range, we return a neutral value (e.g., 0 for sum, infinity for min/max).
		- ### Updates
			- An update operation modifies the value of an element in the original array. To update the segment tree, we first update the corresponding leaf node, and then propagate the changes up to the root node.
			- The update process is also typically recursive. Given an index `idx` and a new value `val`, the segment tree is updated as follows:
				- If the range `[start, end]` contains only one element (i.e., `start == end`), then we update the value of the leaf node to `val`.
				- Otherwise, we check if `idx` falls in the left half or the right half of the range.
				- Recursively update the corresponding child.
				- Update the value of the current node by combining the values of its two children.
	- ## Detailed Examples
		- Let's consider an array `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]` and build a segment tree to support range sum queries and updates.
		- ### Construction Example
			- The segment tree for the array `arr` would look like this (values in the nodes represent the sum of the corresponding range):
			- ```
			  [1, 6] (36)
			                 /        \
			          [1, 3] (16)      [4, 6] (20)
			         /      \          /      \
			     [1, 2] (4)  [3, 3] (5)  [4, 5] (16)  [6, 6] (11)
			    /     \                  /     \
			  [1, 1](1) [2, 2](3)    [4, 4](7) [5, 5](9)
			  ```
			- Each node is labeled with the range it represents and the sum of the elements in that range.
		- ### Range Query Example
			- Suppose we want to find the sum of elements in the range `[2, 5]` (inclusive). This corresponds to the sub-array `[3, 5, 7, 9]`.
				- 1.  Start at the root node `[1, 6]`. The query range `[2, 5]` is not completely contained within `[1, 6]`, so we need to explore its children.
				- 2.  Go to the left child `[1, 3]`. The query range `[2, 5]` is not completely contained within `[1, 3]`, so we need to explore its children.
				- 3.  Go to the left child `[1, 2]`. The query range `[2, 5]` is not completely contained within `[1, 2]`, so we need to explore its children.
				- 4.  Go to the left child `[1, 1]`. The query range `[2, 5]` does not overlap with `[1, 1]`, so we return 0.
				- 5.  Go to the right child `[2, 2]`. The query range `[2, 5]` overlaps with `[2, 2]`, so we return 3.
				- 6.  Now we are back at node `[1, 2]`. The sum of its children is 0 + 3 = 3.
				- 7.  Go to the right child `[3, 3]`. The query range `[2, 5]` overlaps with `[3, 3]`, so we return 5.
				- 8.  Now we are back at node `[1, 3]`. The sum of its children is 3 + 5 = 8.
				- 9.  Go to the right child `[4, 6]`. The query range `[2, 5]` is not completely contained within `[4, 6]`, so we need to explore its children.
				- 10.  Go to the left child `[4, 5]`. The query range `[2, 5]` overlaps with `[4, 5]`, so we return 16.
				- 11.  Go to the right child `[6, 6]`. The query range `[2, 5]` does not overlap with `[6, 6]`, so we return 0.
				- 12.  Now we are back at node `[4, 6]`. The sum of its children is 16 + 0 = 16.
				- 13.  Now we are back at the root node `[1, 6]`. The sum of its children is 8 + 16 = 24.
			- Therefore, the sum of elements in the range `[2, 5]` is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24.
		- ### Update Example
			- Suppose we want to update the value of `arr[3]` from 7 to 10.
				- 1.  Start at the root node `[1, 6]`.
				- 2.  Go to the left child `[1, 3]`. The index 3 falls within this range.
				- 3.  Go to the right child `[3, 3]`. The index 3 falls within this range.
				- 4.  Update the value of the leaf node `[3, 3]` to 10.
				- 5.  Now we are back at node `[1, 3]`. Update its value to 1 + 3 + 10 = 14.
				- 6.  Go to the right child `[4, 6]`. The index 3 does not fall within this range.
				- 7.  Now we are back at the root node `[1, 6]`. Update its value to 14 + 9 + 11 = 34.
			- The updated segment tree would have the following values:
			- ```
			  [1, 6] (34)
			                 /        \
			          [1, 3] (14)      [4, 6] (20)
			         /      \          /      \
			     [1, 2] (4)  [3, 3] (10)  [4, 5] (16)  [6, 6] (11)
			    /     \                  /     \
			  [1, 1](1) [2, 2](3)    [4, 4](7) [5, 5](9)
			  ```
		- ### Code Implementation (Python)
			- ```
			  class SegmentTree:
			      def __init__(self, arr):
			          self.arr = arr
			          self.n = len(arr)
			          self.tree = [0] * (4 * self.n)  # Allocate memory for the tree
			          self.build(0, 0, self.n - 1)  # Build the segment tree
			      def build(self, node, start, end):
			          # If the range contains only one element
			          if start == end:
			              self.tree[node] = self.arr[start]
			              return
			          # Divide the range into two halves
			          mid = (start + end) // 2
			          # Recursively build the left and right subtrees
			          self.build(2 * node + 1, start, mid)
			          self.build(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end)
			          # The value of the current node is the sum of its children
			          self.tree[node] = self.tree[2 * node + 1] + self.tree[2 * node + 2]
			      def query(self, node, start, end, left, right):
			          # If the query range is completely outside the node's range
			          if right < start or end < left:
			              return 0
			          # If the query range is completely contained within the node's range
			          if left <= start and end <= right:
			              return self.tree[node]
			          # Divide the range into two halves
			          mid = (start + end) // 2
			          # Recursively query the left and right subtrees
			          left_sum = self.query(2 * node + 1, start, mid, left, right)
			          right_sum = self.query(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, left, right)
			          # Return the sum of the results
			          return left_sum + right_sum
			      def update(self, node, start, end, idx, val):
			          # If the range contains only one element
			          if start == end:
			              self.arr[idx] = val
			              self.tree[node] = val
			              return
			          # Divide the range into two halves
			          mid = (start + end) // 2
			          # Recursively update the left or right subtree
			          if idx <= mid:
			              self.update(2 * node + 1, start, mid, idx, val)
			          else:
			              self.update(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, idx, val)
			          # Update the value of the current node
			          self.tree[node] = self.tree[2 * node + 1] + self.tree[2 * node + 2]
			  # Example usage:
			  arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
			  st = SegmentTree(arr)
			  # Query the sum of elements in the range [1, 4]
			  print(st.query(0, 0, len(arr) - 1, 1, 4))  # Output: 24 (3 + 5 + 7 + 9)
			  # Update the value of arr[2] to 10
			  st.update(0, 0, len(arr) - 1, 2, 10)
			  # Query the sum of elements in the range [1, 4] again
			  print(st.query(0, 0, len(arr) - 1, 1, 4))  # Output: 29 (3 + 10 + 7 + 9)
			  ```
		- ### Time Complexity
			- **Construction:** O(n)
			- **Query:** O(log n)
			- **Update:** O(log n)
	- ## Advanced Examples
		- ### Lazy Propagation
			- In some cases, we need to perform range updates, where we update all the elements in a given range by the same value. A naive approach would take O(n) time for each range update, which can be inefficient if we have a large number of range updates.
			- Lazy propagation is a technique that allows us to perform range updates in O(log n) time. The idea is to delay the updates to the individual elements until they are actually needed.
			- When we perform a range update, we first update the nodes that completely overlap with the update range. Instead of updating the children of these nodes, we store the update information in a "lazy" array.
			- When we perform a query or update operation on a node, we first check if there is any pending update in the lazy array. If there is, we apply the update to the node and propagate the update to its children.
		- ### Example: Range Addition with Lazy Propagation
			- Let's consider an array `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]` and build a segment tree with lazy propagation to support range addition queries and updates.
			- Suppose we want to add 2 to all elements in the range `[2, 4]`.
				- 1.  Start at the root node `[1, 6]`. The update range `[2, 4]` is not completely contained within `[1, 6]`, so we need to explore its children.
				- 2.  Go to the left child `[1, 3]`. The update range `[2, 4]` is not completely contained within `[1, 3]`, so we need to explore its children.
				- 3.  Go to the left child `[1, 2]`. The update range `[2, 4]` overlaps with `[1, 2]`, but is not completely contained. Explore its children.
				- 4.  Go to the left child `[1, 1]`. The update range `[2, 4]` does not overlap with `[1, 1]`, so we do nothing.
				- 5.  Go to the right child `[2, 2]`. The update range `[2, 4]` overlaps with `[2, 2]`, so we add 2 to this node. The value becomes 3 + 2 = 5.
				- 6.  Now we are back at node `[1, 2]`. The value becomes 1 + 5 = 6.
				- 7.  Go to the right child `[3, 3]`. The update range `[2, 4]` overlaps with `[3, 3]`, so we add 2 to this node. The value becomes 5 + 2 = 7.
				- 8.  Now we are back at node `[1, 3]`. The value becomes 1 + 5 + 7 = 13.
				- 9.  Go to the right child `[4, 6]`. The update range `[2, 4]` is not completely contained within `[4, 6]`, so we need to explore its children.
				- 10.  Go to the left child `[4, 5]`. The update range `[2, 4]` overlaps with `[4, 5]`, but is not completely contained. Explore its children.
				- 11.  Go to the left child `[4, 4]`. The update range `[2, 4]` overlaps with `[4, 4]`, so we add 2 to this node. The value becomes 7 + 2 = 9.
				- 12.  Go to the right child `[5, 5]`. The update range `[2, 4]` does not overlap with `[5, 5]`, so we do nothing.
				- 13.  Now we are back at node `[4, 5]`. The value becomes 9 + 9 = 18.
				- 14.  Go to the right child `[6, 6]`. The update range `[2, 4]` does not overlap with `[6, 6]`, so we do nothing.
				- 15.  Now we are back at node `[4, 6]`. The value becomes 9 + 9 + 11 = 29.
				- 16.  Now we are back at the root node `[1, 6]`. The value becomes 1 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 + 11 = 42.
		- ### Hypothetical Scenario: E-commerce Product Pricing
			- Consider an e-commerce platform that frequently updates the prices of products based on various factors like demand, competitor pricing, and promotions. The platform needs to efficiently handle range-based discounts (e.g., "apply a 10% discount to all products in the category 'Electronics'").
			- A segment tree with lazy propagation can be used to efficiently implement these range-based price updates. Each leaf node in the segment tree represents a product, and the value stored in the node represents the product's price. The internal nodes store the aggregate price information for a range of products.
			- When a range-based discount is applied, the segment tree is updated using lazy propagation. The discount information is stored in the lazy array, and the actual price updates are delayed until a product's price is accessed (e.g., when a customer views the product page). This ensures that the price updates are performed efficiently, without affecting the platform's performance.
