- # Event Driven Architecture for React
	- How we can create an event driven architecture for React, from a post on Dev.to
- # Introduction
	- Are you tired of the endless tangle of props drilling and callback chains in your React applications? Does managing state and communication between deeply nested components feel like wrestling with spaghetti code?
	- An **event-driven architecture** can simplify your component interactions, reduce complexity, and make your app more maintainable. In this article, I’ll show you how to use a custom `useEvent` hook to decouple components and improve communication across your React app.
	- Let me walk you through it, let's start from
	- > Note: This mechanism is not intended as a replacement for a global state management system but an alternative approach to component communication flow.
	- ## The Problem: Prop Drilling and Callback Chains
		- In modern application development, managing state and communication between components can quickly become cumbersome. This is especially true in scenarios involving **props drilling**—where data must be passed down through multiple levels of nested components—and **callback chains**, which can lead to tangled logic and make code harder to maintain or debug.
		- These challenges often create tightly coupled components, reduce flexibility, and increase the cognitive load for developers trying to trace how data flows through the application. Without a better approach, this complexity can significantly slow down development and lead to a **brittle codebase**.
	- ### A Common Problem: Callback Complexity
		- Take this scenario, for example:
			- The Parent passes props to **Children A**.
			- From there, props are drilled down to **GrandChildren A/B** and eventually to **SubChildren N**.
			- If **SubChildren N** needs to notify the Parent of an event, it triggers a callback _that travels back up through each intermediate component_.
		- This setup becomes harder to manage as the application grows. Intermediate components often act as nothing more than middlemen, forwarding props and callbacks, which bloats the code and reduces maintainability.

		- To address **props drilling**, we often turn to solutions like global state management libraries (e.g., **Zustand**) to streamline data sharing. But what about managing callbacks?
		- This is where an **event-driven approach** can be a game-changer. By decoupling components and relying on events to handle interactions, we can significantly simplify callback management. Let’s explore how this approach works.

		- Instead of relying on direct callbacks to communicate up the tree, **_an event-driven architecture decouples components and centralizes communication_**. Here’s how it works:
