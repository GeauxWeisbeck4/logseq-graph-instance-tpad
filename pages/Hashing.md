- # Hashing
	- Through hashing, we turn complex data into something simpler and more manageable, known as a hash value or hash code. This code acts like a unique tag for the original data, making it way easier and faster to store and find information. This all happens thanks to a clever hash function, a type of mathematical wizardry, which churns out these hash codes quickly and consistently.
	- The real magic of hashing is how it gives us almost instant access to data, no matter how big or complicated the dataset is. It slashes the time needed for search operations, making it a must-have in loads of areas, like databases, quick-access caches, and even in security through cryptography. Hashing lets us zip through huge data sets with ease, opening doors to new solutions and making tricky problems a breeze.
