- # Quick Sort - Divide and Conquer
	- QuickSort is an incredibly efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that is widely utilized for sorting arrays. It follows a straightforward yet immensely powerful approach to sort the elements. The algorithm commences by carefully selecting a 'pivot' element from the array, which serves as an indispensable reference point for partitioning the remaining elements.
	- The meticulous partitioning step meticulously divides the array into two distinct sub-arrays based on whether the elements are comparatively less than or greater than the pivot. This meticulous and intricate process effectively sorts the sub-arrays, which are subsequently and recursively sorted using the QuickSort algorithm.
	- By diligently and consistently partitioning and sorting the sub-arrays, QuickSort triumphantly achieves a remarkably swift and unequivocally dependable sorting solution.
- # Quick Sort Performance
	- QuickSort is known for its remarkable efficiency in most cases. It has an average time complexity of , which means it can sort a large amount of data relatively quickly. However, in certain situations, the worst-case scenario can occur, where the time complexity can be O resulting in a significant decrease in performance. To mitigate this, it is important to implement a good pivot strategy, which helps in avoiding the worst-case scenario and maintaining the efficiency of the algorithm.
