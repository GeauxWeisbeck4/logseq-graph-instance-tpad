			- `type` (required) - Set to `[[Feature]]` to identify it as a feature

			- `description` (optional) - A brief description of what the feature does
			- `initial-version` (optional) - Logseq version the feature was first introduced
			- A feature page normally contains the following sections:
			- `Usage` (required) - Answers the **how** of a feature. Immediately helps a user use a feature
			- `Functionality` (required) - Answers the **what** of a feature. Enumerates all the behaviors of a feature. Important so a user understands what is intended behavior and what is not (a bug).
			- `Background` (optional) - Answers the **why** of a feature by explaining a feature in depth. Good place to find a feature's use cases.
			- `Additional Links` (optional) - Useful place for listing additional references and related pages.
