- # Introduction
	- The time is 5:16 PM and there’s a 6 MPH wind that is adding a slight chill to this lovely 59-degree sprint day here in Durham, North Carolina. It is not quite a [blue bird](https://www.joe-kuhns.com/bluebird-days) type of day out, but there’s good enough visibility for the launch of this newsletter, finally.
	- You might find it ridiculous that a totally unknown writer dude is treating the launch of his obscure newsletter like it is the launch of a Space X rocket that is worth enough money to end homelessness in the United States. This is surely going to piss some people off, but I'd be willing to bet that Jesus Christ would be more impressed with what you are reading right now than he would be standing next to an egocentric billionaire shooting metal containers in to the sky, trying to prove to Jesus could probably be his father if he wanted him to.
		- The scary thing is I'm only partially kidding about that too. The Technocrat Oligarchy that is being created right before our eyes is much more than just an autocratic coup, it is the extension of a cultish belief system that there are Silicon Valley Overlords who shall rule over their non-biological children by forcing them to accept their new world order which is tightly controlled by the few who are the only ones capable of creating a "Utopian World", basically making them Gods by Default or whatever these fucking nerds think...
	- Now, I want to make it very clear I am not saying this newsletter is worthy of Jesus's approval or that it is the greatest piece of writing you have ever laid your eyes on - if it is that good, please subscribe to the expensive subscription and share it with everybody :). But I don't think Jesus would be impressed at all with a man who hoards billions of dollars to himself, spends it on Soviet scrap metal just so to have it explode in the sky and pollute "the heavens" (our atmosphere), and simultaneously gut every program created to help the poor, weak and suffering and call it cutting costs for efficiency, just so he can make room for tax cuts for him and his friends so they can steal whatever scraps that the poorest people in the world are so selfishly keeping to themselves by living off the billionaires hard earned dollars they had to pay taxes on - except they already don't pay taxes really so they are taking tax cuts on zero, which means they'll get tax returns from the government, I guess?
	- I knew Tesla is tanking balls, but I never realized billionaires were going so hungry that they're having to dip into the food stamps program that feed homeless and unemployed people - seriously, I worked at Walmart last year for a little while and was homeless and they cut that shit off IMMEDIATELY. But you can't let suffering poor people freeload off the government or it cuts into the billions of dollars in grants you use for your spaceship fireworks and spying satellites. Now, this is a story for another time, but maybe - just maybe, there is something to Tesla being extremely overvalued and leveraged, so so fucking bad, that the wheels might just come off the fucking place and send Elon freefalling into the abyss, ()like a ketamine comet or something) until all his assets and debt either disintegrate or get put back together by somebody bailing him out.
