	- WeisMind is my personal brand for content, creative stuff, the podcast, and much much more. It is my personal brand that is not completely affiliated with programming/my career in the sense that it is more flexible than something like [[Geaux Code]] or [[Tar Heel Dev Studio]]. It is a new start and it is exciting!

- ## History
  id:: 67dd8b33-0d2a-4da2-a855-873981bd7a50
	- WeisMind originally started out as my consulting business way back in 2017, but eventually took on new shapes and sizes. It was the name of Lisa and I's podcast, the [[WeisMind Podcast]], an awesome program that we intend on bringing back soon. A lot went on in our life at the time we were working on it, things like - losing our housing, me losing a job, COVID shit, and a lot of other shit I won't even start to get into. I've been trying to revive the brand for a few years now, to no avail - or so I thought.
	- Homelessness went from a the-worst-thing-that-ever-coulda-happened-to-me-fuck-this-im-never-getting-out-of-this-shit to the-best-thing-that-ever-happened-to-me-woo-hoo-a-blessing-in-disguise. It gave me an opportunity to learn a lot about myself and realize the illusion that I had been living in for so fucking long - my whole life, man! That spurred me on to believe that writing about whatever it is WeisMind is going to be, will just happen to take form as I write it as along as I write from the heart. Let the words flow, and then edit - the two step writing process.
