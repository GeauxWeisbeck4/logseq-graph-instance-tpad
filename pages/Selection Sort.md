	- Selection Sort, a straightforward and efficient sorting method, operates by consistently choosing the smallest (or largest for descending order) item from the unsorted portion of a list and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This method is repeated until the entire list is in order. The algorithm works by methodically comparing and swapping elements, ensuring that each item, whether smallest or largest, is placed in its proper position. Its simplicity and ease of implementation make it an excellent option for those just starting with sorting algorithms.
