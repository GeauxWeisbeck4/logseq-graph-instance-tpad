# Trie Data Structure: Implementation and Applications
	- Tries, also known as prefix trees, are a tree-like data structure primarily used for efficient retrieval of strings. Unlike binary search trees where each node stores a key associated with the node, trie nodes represent characters. The path from the root to a node represents a prefix of a string stored in the trie. This structure enables fast prefix-based searches, making it highly suitable for applications like autocomplete, spell checking, and IP routing. Understanding tries is crucial for optimizing string-related operations and building efficient search functionalities.
	- ## Trie Structure and Implementation
		- A trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character. The root node represents an empty string, and each child node represents a possible character that can follow the character represented by its parent.
		- ### Node Structure
			- Each node in a trie typically contains the following:
				- An array or hash map of pointers to child nodes, where each pointer corresponds to a possible character. The size of the array is usually determined by the size of the alphabet (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters).
				- A boolean flag to indicate whether the node represents the end of a valid word.
			- ```
			  class TrieNode:
			      def __init__(self):
			          self.children = {}  # Using a dictionary (hash map) for child nodes
			          self.is_end_of_word = False  # Flag to indicate end of a word
			  # Example usage:
			  node = TrieNode()
			  node.children['a'] = TrieNode() # Add a child node for the character 'a'
			  ```
		- ### Insertion
			- To insert a word into a trie, start from the root node and traverse the trie character by character. For each character in the word:
				- 1.  Check if the current node has a child node corresponding to the character.
				- 2.  If the child node exists, move to that node.
				- 3.  If the child node does not exist, create a new node, add it as a child of the current node, and then move to the new node.
				- 4.  After processing all characters in the word, mark the last node as the end of a word.
			- ```
			  class Trie:
			      def __init__(self):
			          self.root = TrieNode()
			      def insert(self, word):
			          node = self.root
			          for char in word:
			              if char not in node.children:
			                  node.children[char] = TrieNode()
			              node = node.children[char]
			          node.is_end_of_word = True
			  # Example usage:
			  trie = Trie()
			  trie.insert("apple")
			  trie.insert("app")
			  ```
		- ### Search
			- To search for a word in a trie, start from the root node and traverse the trie character by character. For each character in the word:
				- 1.  Check if the current node has a child node corresponding to the character.
				- 2.  If the child node exists, move to that node.
				- 3.  If the child node does not exist, the word is not in the trie, so return `False`.
				- 4.  After processing all characters in the word, check if the last node is marked as the end of a word. If it is, the word exists in the trie, so return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.
			- ```
			  class Trie:
			      def __init__(self):
			          self.root = TrieNode()
			      def insert(self, word):
			          node = self.root
			          for char in word:
			              if char not in node.children:
			                  node.children[char] = TrieNode()
			              node = node.children[char]
			          node.is_end_of_word = True
			      def search(self, word):
			          node = self.root
			          for char in word:
			              if char not in node.children:
			                  return False
			              node = node.children[char]
			          return node.is_end_of_word
			  # Example usage:
			  trie = Trie()
			  trie.insert("apple")
			  trie.insert("app")
			  print(trie.search("apple"))  # Output: True
			  print(trie.search("app"))    # Output: True
			  print(trie.search("banana")) # Output: False
			  ```
		- ### Prefix Search
			- Prefix search is a key feature of tries. To search for a prefix in a trie, start from the root node and traverse the trie character by character. For each character in the prefix:
				- 1.  Check if the current node has a child node corresponding to the character.
				- 2.  If the child node exists, move to that node.
				- 3.  If the child node does not exist, the prefix is not in the trie, so return `False`.
				- 4.  After processing all characters in the prefix, return `True` (since the prefix exists).
			- ```
			  class Trie:
			      def __init__(self):
			          self.root = TrieNode()
			      def insert(self, word):
			          node = self.root
			          for char in word:
			              if char not in node.children:
			                  node.children[char] = TrieNode()
			              node = node.children[char]
			          node.is_end_of_word = True
			      def search(self, word):
			          node = self.root
			          for char in word:
			              if char not in node.children:
			                  return False
			              node = node.children[char]
			          return node.is_end_of_word
			      def starts_with(self, prefix):
			          node = self.root
			          for char in prefix:
			              if char not in node.children:
			                  return False
			              node = node.children[char]
			          return True
			  # Example usage:
			  trie = Trie()
			  trie.insert("apple")
			  trie.insert("app")
			  print(trie.starts_with("app"))  # Output: True
			  print(trie.starts_with("appl")) # Output: True
			  print(trie.starts_with("bana")) # Output: False
			  ```
		- ### Deletion
			- Deleting a word from a trie involves traversing the trie to find the end node of the word and then removing the nodes that are no longer part of any other word.
				- 1.  **Locate the Word:** Search for the word in the trie. If the word doesn't exist, there's nothing to delete.
				- 2.  **Unmark the End Node:** If the word exists, unmark the `is_end_of_word` flag of the last character's node.
				- 3.  **Remove Redundant Nodes:** Starting from the last character's node, traverse back up towards the root. If a node has no children and is not the end of any other word, it can be safely deleted. This step ensures that the trie remains efficient by removing unnecessary nodes.
			- ```
			  class Trie:
			      def __init__(self):
			          self.root = TrieNode()
			      def insert(self, word):
			          node = self.root
			          for char in word:
			              if char not in node.children:
			                  node.children[char] = TrieNode()
			              node = node.children[char]
			          node.is_end_of_word = True
			      def search(self, word):
			          node = self.root
			          for char in word:
			              if char not in node.children:
			                  return False
			              node = node.children[char]
			          return node.is_end_of_word
			      def starts_with(self, prefix):
			          node = self.root
			          for char in prefix:
			              if char not in node.children:
			                  return False
			              node = node.children[char]
			          return True
			      def delete(self, word):
			          self._delete_recursive(self.root, word, 0)
			      def _delete_recursive(self, node, word, index):
			          if index == len(word):
			              if not node.is_end_of_word:
			                  return False  # Word not present
			              node.is_end_of_word = False
			              return len(node.children) == 0
			          char = word[index]
			          if char not in node.children:
			              return False  # Word not present
			          should_delete_child = self._delete_recursive(node.children[char], word, index + 1)
			          if should_delete_child:
			              del node.children[char]
			              return len(node.children) == 0
			          return False
			  # Example Usage:
			  trie = Trie()
			  trie.insert("apple")
			  trie.insert("app")
			  print(trie.search("apple")) # True
			  trie.delete("apple")
			  print(trie.search("apple")) # False
			  print(trie.search("app"))   # True
			  ```
		- ### Time and Space Complexity
			- **Insertion:** O(k), where k is the length of the word.
			- **Search:** O(k), where k is the length of the word.
			- **Prefix Search:** O(k), where k is the length of the prefix.
			- **Deletion:** O(k), where k is the length of the word.
			- **Space:** O(N * m * k), where N is the number of words, m is the average word length, and k is the alphabet size. The space complexity can be a concern for large datasets with long words.
	- ## Trie Applications
		- Tries are used in various applications that require efficient string retrieval and prefix-based searches.
		- ### Autocomplete
			- Autocomplete systems use tries to suggest words or phrases as the user types. The trie stores a dictionary of known words, and as the user enters a prefix, the trie is traversed to find all words starting with that prefix.
			- **Example:**
			- Consider an autocomplete system for a search engine. The trie contains words like "apple," "application," "apply," "banana," and "band."
				- 1.  **User Input:** The user types "app."
				- 2.  **Trie Traversal:** The trie is traversed to the node representing the prefix "app."
				- 3.  **Suggestion Generation:** All words starting with "app" are retrieved from the trie (e.g., "apple," "application," "apply").
				- 4.  **Display Suggestions:** The suggestions are displayed to the user.
		- ### Spell Checking
			- Spell checkers use tries to verify the correctness of words. The trie stores a dictionary of valid words, and when a word is entered, the spell checker searches for it in the trie. If the word is not found, the spell checker suggests possible corrections based on words in the trie that are similar to the entered word.
			- **Example:**
			- Consider a spell checker for a text editor. The trie contains words like "correct," "incorrect," "hello," and "world."
				- 1.  **User Input:** The user types "incoorect."
				- 2.  **Trie Search:** The spell checker searches for "incoorect" in the trie.
				- 3.  **Suggestion Generation:** Since "incoorect" is not found, the spell checker suggests "incorrect" based on similar words in the trie.
				- 4.  **Display Suggestions:** The suggestion "incorrect" is displayed to the user.
		- ### IP Routing
			- In IP routing, tries can be used to store routing tables. Each node in the trie represents a prefix of an IP address, and the path from the root to a node represents a specific IP address range. When a packet arrives, the router uses the destination IP address to traverse the trie and find the longest matching prefix, which indicates the next hop for the packet.
			- **Example:**
			- Consider a router with the following IP address prefixes in its routing table:
				- `192.168.1.0/24` (Network A)
				- `192.168.1.128/25` (Subnet B)
				- `10.0.0.0/8` (Network C)
				- 1.  **Packet Arrival:** A packet arrives with a destination IP address of `192.168.1.130`.
				- 2.  **Trie Traversal:** The router traverses the trie using the destination IP address.
				- 3.  **Longest Prefix Match:** The longest matching prefix is `192.168.1.128/25` (Subnet B).
				- 4.  **Forward Packet:** The packet is forwarded to the next hop associated with Subnet B.
		- ### Contact List
			- Tries can be used to implement a contact list with efficient search and autocomplete features. Each contact's name is stored in the trie, allowing for quick retrieval of contacts based on prefixes.
			- **Example:**
			- Consider a contact list application with the following names: "Alice," "Bob," "Charlie," "David," and "Eve."
				- 1.  **User Input:** The user types "A."
				- 2.  **Trie Traversal:** The trie is traversed to the node representing the prefix "A."
				- 3.  **Suggestion Generation:** All contacts starting with "A" are retrieved from the trie (e.g., "Alice").
				- 4.  **Display Suggestions:** The suggestion "Alice" is displayed to the user.
		- ### Hypothetical Scenario: DNA Sequencing
			- Imagine a bioinformatics application that needs to analyze DNA sequences. DNA sequences are strings composed of four characters: A, C, G, and T. A trie can be used to store a large database of known DNA sequences. This allows for efficient searching of specific sequences or identifying sequences with common prefixes, which can be useful for identifying related genes or organisms.
				- 1.  **Data Storage:** Known DNA sequences are inserted into the trie. For example, "ACGT," "ACGA," "CGTA," etc.
				- 2.  **Sequence Search:** A researcher can quickly search for a specific DNA sequence to see if it exists in the database.
				- 3.  **Prefix Analysis:** The trie can be used to find all sequences that start with a particular prefix, which might indicate a common genetic marker.
	- ## Exercises
		- 1.  **Implement a Trie:** Write a Python class `Trie` with `insert`, `search`, and `starts_with` methods. Test it with a set of sample words.
		- 2.  **Autocomplete System:** Use the `Trie` class to implement a simple autocomplete system. Given a prefix, return all words in the trie that start with that prefix.
		- 3.  **Spell Checker:** Extend the `Trie` class to implement a basic spell checker. Given a word, if it's not in the trie, suggest the closest word(s) based on edit distance (Levenshtein distance).
		- 4.  **Contact List:** Implement a contact list using a Trie. The contact list should allow adding new contacts, searching for contacts by name, and autocompleting contact names as the user types.
