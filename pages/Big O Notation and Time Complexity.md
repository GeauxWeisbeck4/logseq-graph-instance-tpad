	- Time complexity is a vital concept in computer science that sheds light on how an algorithm's performance changes with the size of the input data. It's more about getting a rough idea of how the algorithm behaves, rather than pinning down its exact runtime.
	- Take an example to make sense of this. Suppose you have a function that processes a list of n items, checking each one to find a particular value. If the list gets longer, the search time goes up in a direct line with the list's length. This scenario is what you'd call linear time complexity.
	- Grasping time complexity is key for analyzing and crafting algorithms. It empowers us to pick the right algorithm, taking into account how it's likely to perform and scale with different sizes of input data. By factoring in an algorithm's time complexity, we're able to fine-tune our code and boost the overall efficiency of our programs.
