		- ### Data Representations
			- How can we represent data in a way that computers can understand?
				- Organize info into a vector
					- One dimensional array of numbers that has magnitude and direction
					- Totality of vectors with n-entries is an n-dimensional vector space
						- 3 Dimensional space is a 3
