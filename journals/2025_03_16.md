			- I am exhausted today which sucks. I need to stay awake cause I'm inside Panera but I can barely keep my eyes open I keep sort of trying to doze off and I'm trying to fight that with this free write session right now. It's gonna be a long day if I can't fight this and stay awake. Gonna have to though and that's the end of it. I have so much energy, I'm a supernova in a blackhole - that makes no sense. I need a slap to the face, a wake me up. A kick to the nuts or slap in the face - anything to get get my ass Going.
