			- ## 10-Minute Freewriting Session {{renderer :pomodoro_zjjus,10,1741294378329}}
				- Well today is more than just a late start - it's a way too fucking late start accompanied by the fact I was ripped off and still haven't gotten my end of the deal from Angie after traveling way out to where she lives in Roguemont via Uber and her not having all of that which I paid for. That is why this ten minute freewriting session is so short - because I can barely keep my fucking eyes open. Ugh, I need to fight through the tiredness and pain though.
