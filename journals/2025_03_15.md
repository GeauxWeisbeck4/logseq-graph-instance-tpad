	- ## 10-Minute Freewriting Session {{renderer :pomodoro_hwhek,10,1742074040515}}
		- Getting this freewriting session started a little late today because I needed to get started on working on my template stuff. I successfully sold my first template through Creative Market yesterday and that has only motivated me to work on some other stuff that might make some money. The next needs to be getting to work on my Substack newsletter WeisMind.
