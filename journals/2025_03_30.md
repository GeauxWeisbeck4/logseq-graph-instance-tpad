				- Welcome to the 10-minute freewriting session, my name is Andrew and I will be your writer today. I would like to explore the theme of saying things today. We all say things. Some things we say are smart, but most are stupid. That is because most of us are really stupid. I'm talking about Americans in the collective sense, sorry rest of the world, I didn't mean to make a broad judgment on humanity... well never mind, we are all stupid. I was thinking like, "Ok let's think about who's not stupid...". I thought about the Middle East - they all blow each other up over which sect of Islam is more hardcore. Practically a multi-nation gang war
