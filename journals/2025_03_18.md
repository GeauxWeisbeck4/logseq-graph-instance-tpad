	- ## {{renderer :pomodoro_mycvm,10,1742316674327}}  10-Minute freewriting Session
		- It is the beginning of the day and it is time for me to get in the flow to kick some ass. I'm feeling some DSA and ML learning stuff to start the day and also working at that Kendo React Hackathon. It is a beautiful/hot day outside, but I'm lucky enough to have a nice new computer to work on inside of Panera. I should try to get some writing done, but I really need to focus on the learning and job searching today. Maybe building some stuff, but mainly just programming shit ya know. Some Supabase and Next.js would be a good space to operate in for that Fast.ai job. I can also get to work on my Portfolio for real. I need to stop half assing things and see them through to the end. I say that, but I don't know if I'll get through this full 10 minute writing session again. Kind of just taking what I need from it as I know I can write and do shit. Just too busy to sit and fuck around really. Yay, two wins in Field Goal Faceoff.
