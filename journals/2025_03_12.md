		- Well here we are - the day after getting fucked out of a whole good day of work. It's frustrating and irritating that this situation is what it is right now. Spent the whole day worrying about getting over to Slim's to help him get ready for his appraisal and it fucked us over sideways. I don't feel good, we missed the clinic, and I missed an entire day of work which was very important to not miss. I am basically out of what I need for my ADHD and a whole day is gone that I can't get back. He just has no concept of other people's needs really and I'm just really pissed off today. I need to snap out of it because I have shit to do really. So today I need to finish that portfolio site and get some content created. Don't have time to fuck around with that and I need to get my resume updated and sent to all the people who've been waiting on me. This shit is really hard and I'm getting worn down by trying to figure things out. Slim
