			- I am writing I am writing. Today is a beautiful morning. Well, besides the pollen it is a beautiful morning. We also made it to the clinic on time on a Saturday which is wonderful. I am writing writing writing. I need to get that writing done for my newsletter and Geaux Code - in fact, that is going to be the first order of business in today's chapter meeting of procrastination n masturbation of the minds local chapter. Great music at Panera - it's the good part of their playlist. I need headphones so I can start listening to Saturday morning bluegrass again, the Mountain Stage radio. I also am going to win this fucking parlay today - I've missed 6 parlays now by one player, by a couple points. Had it gone the other way, I would have like $25,000. That is hard to think about when you have no money and things suck, but the flip side of that is that there is a winner coming and its coming very soon.
