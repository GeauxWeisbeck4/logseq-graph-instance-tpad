# Thursday - March 12th, 2025 - Sprint 17W1D4
	- # 10-Minute Freewriting Session {{renderer :pomodoro_lhfsq,10,1741896795086}}
		- Just had my interview with Fastbreak.ai and it went exceedingly well. It's time to get on a whole new level of preparation, showcasing, and creating. I'm going to master all of the technologies that they need before they get around to wanting to interview me. I want to show that I am their guy, no questions asked. It's in Charlotte but that doesn't really matter if it pays well and its a job working with sports - especially with the SEC, Big East, and NBA. I need to build prototypes of the things I talked about in the interview so they all match up to what I've said. I think I'm going to pop on over to that right now as a matter of fact.
