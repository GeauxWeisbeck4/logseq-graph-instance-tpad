# Wednesday - March 19th, 2025
	- Didn't get around to the 10 minute freewriting session for Wednesday, so here is a recap. Did a lot of reading, some coding, and there was a fair bit of learning. I dipped my toe back into Strapi and there are some projects I want to wrangle together into a list of must do tutorials that I need to complete.
